The curse of dimensionality is a blessing in disguise. Although multi-dimensional arrays in R are restricted to the six basic types, many programming languages vectors and arrays as a template, which means that you can make such compound objects from any type of object that you like. 

This becomes especially handy when it comes to organisation of high-dimensional, spatial data. 



## The package

The base class `VirtualArray` is defined, which acts as a wrapper around lists allowing users to fold arbitrary sequential data into *n*-dimensional, R-style virtual arrays. The derived `XArray` class is defined to be used for homogeneous lists that contain a single class of objects. The `RasterArray`, `SfcArray` and `SfArray` classes enable the use of stacked spatial data instead of lists.

## Notes 

#### History

The functions here were originally developed and published as part of the [chronosphere](https://cran.r-project.org/package=chronosphere) R package. For better compliance with [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and more efficient distribution/development, the original chronosphere has been broken up to three R packages:

- [`rgplates`](https://adamkocsis.github.io/rgplates/): functions related to tectonic reconstructions.
- [`via`](https://adamkocsis.github.io/via/): Virtual Arrays for efficient organisation of high-dimenional data.
- `chronosphere`: version-controlled data distribution.

This is a pre-alpha version, and like R, comes with absolutely no warranty.
